#Surf 1685 Pattern Library

Version 1.0

**A pattern library for a fictitious surf apparel company.**

## Project Description & Motivation

Throughout the term for Web Development 4 we worked on the  design of a complete eCommerce website. Each week we designed different components of the website. In the second half of the term we took all those common components and use them to build out a home page, and a product list page. And finally, near the end of the term, we handed each of our pattern libraries off to one of our class peers who  created the product details page and our checkout form page.

I chose to create a pattern library for surf apparel because I have always wanted to surf, and this project provided me an opportunity to learn more about the sport.

Surf 1685's vision is to be known as the top of the market for all surf gear. The website allows surfers of every experience level to purchase items such as wetsuits, swimwear, and cover-ups, while ensuring quality and top-of-the-line trends.

## Context

The primary goals to this large-scale assignment are:

1. To think in terms of components and pieces instead of pages—major websites are just made up of many, many small pieces; pages are nothing more than groupings of those pieces
To start to think about working with other people, and how to create a system that someone else can step into and take over
2. Pretend in this project that we're the “designer” working on a team-we're creating a system of possible patterns and some example pages
Eventually you’ll hand off the whole system to a “developer” (your peer) to finalize the rest of the pages and make the whole thing work
3. To get lots of practice coding—because we need it
