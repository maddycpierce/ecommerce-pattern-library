  Buttons should be used in different situation where a dramatic, obvious action is required. Try not to over use buttons because they should be the primary call-to-action for a screen. It is okay to change the 'font-size' class of the buttons to make them different sizes.

patterns:
  basic:
    title: "Basic"
    width: "12em"
    fields:
      - name: button_text
        type: string
        example: "Shop Now"
      - name: url
        type: url
        example: "/womens-swim/"
